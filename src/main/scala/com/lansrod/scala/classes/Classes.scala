   * This Point class has four members: the variables x and y and the methods move and toString.
   * Unlike many other languages, the primary constructor is in the class signature (var x: Int, var y: Int).
   * The move method takes two integer arguments and returns the Unit value (), which carries no information.
   * This corresponds roughly with void in Java-like languages.
   * toString, on the other hand, does not take any arguments but returns a String value.
   * Since toString overrides toString from AnyRef, it is tagged with the override keyword.
