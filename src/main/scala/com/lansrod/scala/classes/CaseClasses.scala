  //A minimal case class requires the keywords case class, an identifier, and a parameter list (which may be empty):

  case class Book(isbn: String)

  val frankenstein = Book("978-0486282114")

  //Notice how the keyword new was not used to instantiate the Book case class.
  //This is because case classes have an apply method by default which takes care of object construction.

  //When you create a case class with parameters, the parameters are public vals.

  case class Message(sender: String, recipient: String, body: String)
  val message1 = Message("guillaume@quebec.ca", "jorge@catalonia.es", "Ça va ?")

  println(message1.sender) // prints guillaume@quebec.ca
  //message1.sender = "travis@washington.us" // this line does not compile

  //You can’t reassign message1.sender because it is a val (i.e. immutable). It is possible to use vars in case classes but this is discouraged.

  //Comparison
  //Case classes are compared by structure and not by reference:

  val message2 = Message("jorge@catalonia.es", "guillaume@quebec.ca", "Com va?")
  val message3 = Message("jorge@catalonia.es", "guillaume@quebec.ca", "Com va?")
  val messagesAreTheSame = message2 == message3 // true
  println(messagesAreTheSame)
  //Even though message2 and message3 refer to different objects, the value of each object is equal.

  //Copying
  //You can create a (shallow) copy of an instance of a case class simply by using the copy method. You can optionally change the constructor arguments.
  val message4 = Message("julien@bretagne.fr", "travis@washington.us", "Me zo o komz gant ma amezeg")
  val message5 = message4.copy(sender = message4.recipient, recipient = "claire@bourgogne.fr")
  println(message5.sender) // travis@washington.us
  println(message5.recipient) // claire@bourgogne.fr
  println(message5.body) // "Me zo o komz gant ma amezeg"

  //The recipient of message4 is used as the sender of message5 but the body of message4 was copied directly.
