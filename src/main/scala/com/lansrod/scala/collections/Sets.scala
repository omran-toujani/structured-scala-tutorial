/*Sets are Iterables that contain no duplicate elements.
 *The operations on sets are summarized in the following table for general sets and in the table after that for mutable sets.
 *They fall into the following categories:
 *Tests contains, apply, subsetOf. The contains method asks whether a set contains a given element.
 *The apply method for a set is the same as contains, so set(elem) is the same as set contains elem.
 *That means sets can also be used as test functions that return true for the elements they contain.
